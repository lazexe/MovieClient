Test task for BetterMe
Postman collection: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/ff1e4045b9e2a92dfef5

What can be implemented:
- Need to add ExpandableTextView for better UX on  https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/6656

Functional requirements:
- (+) As a user I see the list of ongoing movies for two last weeks period;
- (+) As a user I can refresh the list of movies using pull-to-refresh;
- (+) As a user I can view the list of movies without internet connection;
- (+) As a user I can add or remove each movie to bookmarks (all changes should become visible instantly);
- (+) As a user I can share each movie info (via any provider);
- (+) As a user I can see the list of my bookmarked movies;

Each data-bound operation should have one of these states at UI:
- (-) empty state
- (+) in progress
- (+) failed (with reason: i.e. connectivity / server issue);
- (+) success (data is shown);

Technical requirements
- (+) Clean Architecture patterns are mandatory;
- (+) Proper dependency injection is required;
- (MVVM) Redux / MVP / MVVM / MVI architecture is required;
- (+) Unit-tests are mandatory;

Notes
You can change this project setup (it's just a template) and use whatever libraries you want;
- (+) We expect you to build scalable architecture based on SOLID principles;
- (-) We expect that you donâ€™t spend a lot of time by polishing the UI, but some fancy animations will be a big plus;
- (+) 100% code coverage is not necessary: you are free to test only the most important parts of logic;
